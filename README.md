# E-commerce Analysis: Customer Behavior and Delivery performance
This repository ontains the code and data for analyzing customer behavior and delivery performance in an e-commerce business using a dataset from a specific e-commerce company. The primary objective of this research is to gain insights into various aspects of the e-commerce operations and make data-driven decisions to improve delivery performance, reduce lead time, and detect fraud.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this analysis is provided by a Dataco supply chain data and contains information related to customer behavior, delivery performance, product quality, and sales. It includes variables such as order date, customer ID, delivery status, product information, lead time, sales, and more. The dataset allows us to explore and analyze various aspects of the e-commerce business.

## Objectives:
The main objectives of this research are as follows:

Reduce lead time: Investigate factors and strategies to minimize lead time and improve delivery speed.

Improve delivery performance: Analyze delivery performance metrics, identify bottlenecks, and propose strategies for improvement.

Assess product quality: Evaluate the quality level of products in the e-commerce dataset to ensure customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Winsorization technique: Apply the Winsorization technique to handle outliers and examine its impact on the distribution of data variables.

Fraud detection with logistic regression: Explore the effectiveness of logistic regression in detecting fraud in the e-commerce dataset.

Late delivery prediction with Random Forest: Evaluate the effectiveness of Random Forest in predicting late deliveries in the e-commerce dataset.

## Results:
The analysis of the dataset yielded the following key findings:

Average days for shipping: The average time taken to ship orders is 3.5 days.

Average benefit per order: The average profit per order is $21.97.

Sales per customer: The dataset provides insights into the total sales for each customer, with some customers spending more than others.

Mean Lead Time: The average lead time for orders is 9.90 days.

Number of unique products sold: The dataset includes 118 different products.

Percentage of Late Deliveries: Approximately 54.83% of the orders were delivered late.

Accuracy for fraud detection: The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 97% in detecting fraud.

Accuracy for late delivery prediction: The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 78% in predicting late deliveries.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, this research study provides valuable insights into customer behavior, delivery performance, and predictive modeling in the e-commerce industry. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of lead time optimization, quality assessment, fraud detection, and late delivery prediction. The results can be used to inform decision-making and drive improvements in the e-commerce business, ultimately leading to enhanced customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and cost management.
